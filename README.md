# Mad Bars

Mad Bars is a desktop application designed for visualizing test data in various programming languages

> Mad bars is designed to be simple to implement into an existing project
> and easy to work with due to the multiple pre-written bindings

### Tech

Mad Bars relies on multiple technologies:

* [node.js] - Where the bulk of the application runs
* [Express] - Used for streamlining the routes for post reuquests
* [electron] - Used to create cross-platform desktop applications with node
* [amcharts] - Used to create the chart visuals

### Installation

### Development

Feel free to make any pull requests that you feel help to improve the project in any way

### Todos

 - Replace Pug with HTML (pug isn't really needed, I just used it because I'm used to it) 
 - Replace Amcharts with D3js charts - allows more flexibility with the graphs
